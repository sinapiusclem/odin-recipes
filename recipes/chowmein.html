<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
   <li>¼ cup vegetable stock</li> 
   <li>2 teaspoons liquid amino acids (such as Bragg®)</li>
   <li>½ teaspoon white sugar</li>
   <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
   <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
   <li>1 tablespoon vegetable mix</li>
   <li>2 teaspoons peanut oil</li>
   <li>1 cup canned large lima beans</li>
   <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
   <li>½ pound sweet onions (such as Vidalia®), sliced</li>
   <li>1 rib celery, sliced diagonally</li>
   <li>1 cup cooked brown rice</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li> Combine 1/4 cup vegetable stock, liquid amino acids, sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a cup. Whisk cornstarch and 1 tablespoon vegetable stock together in a separate cup until smooth.</li>
    <li> Heat peanut oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat; add lima beans and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cook and stir beans until partially warmed, 2 to 3 minutes. Add onions and celery, lower heat to medium, and cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are heated through and coated in oil, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
    <li> Pour vegetable stock-liquid amino mixture over bean mixture and turn heat to high. Cover wok and cook over medium heat for 4 minutes. Stir cornstarch mixture into bean mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until sauce is thickened, about 1 minute. Serve with brown rice.</li>
