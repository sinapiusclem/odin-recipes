    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Delicious vegan Thai coconut curry with panang curry paste. Serve over white rice.</p>
    <p>Tastes best if cooked in the slow cooker for multiple hours, but it is also a good option for a quick meal.</p>
</br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package extra-firm tofu, cubed</li>
        <li>½ medium yellow onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons panang curry paste</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable broth</li>
        <li>4 large red potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>¼ cup string beans</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add tofu and fry on all sides until golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat. </li>
        <li>While tofu is frying, heat remaining oil in a separate pan over medium heat. Saute onion until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in curry paste. Pour in coconut milk and vegetable broth; bring to a boil. Add potatoes, reduce heat, and simmer, covering the pot loosely, until potatoes are halfway cooked, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in beans and continue to simmer until potatoes are almost soft, about 5 minutes more. Stir in tofu and heat through, about 5 minutes. Serve in individual bowls.</li>
    </ol>
